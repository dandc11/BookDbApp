# BookDbApp
This was an early app build with Microsoft's RazorPages. It lets users keep track of the books they've read, similar to GoodReads. Working on it gave me a chance to improve with full stack development, including:

- ASP.NET
- C#
- SQL Server
- Bootstrap
- Vanilla Javascript
- CSS
- APIs
